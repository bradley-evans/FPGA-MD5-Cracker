ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:18 - The design is too large for the given device and package. 
   Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device.

   NOTE: An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

   This mapped NCD file can be used to evaluate how the design's logic has been
   mapped into FPGA logic resources.  It can also be used to analyze
   preliminary, logic-level (pre-route) timing with one of the Xilinx static
   timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing Analyzer).

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      2
Number of warnings:   28
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           660 out of   3,584   18%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,361 out of   3,584   37%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,063 out of   1,792   59%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,063 out of   1,063 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,063   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,425 out of   3,584   39%
    Number used as logic:             1,361
    Number used as a route-thru:         64

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                645 out of      68  948% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
  Number of RAMB16BWEs:                   1 out of      16    6%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.57

Peak Memory Usage:  212 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
